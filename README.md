# Road-Accidents-Dashboard

## Project Summary:

The "Road Accident Dashboard" project focuses on analyzing and visualizing road accident data spanning from 2019 to 2022. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, encompassing various attributes such as accident severity, date, geographical coordinates, light conditions, district area, casualties, vehicles involved, road surface conditions, road type, urban/rural classification, weather conditions, and vehicle type, the project aimed to glean actionable insights to enhance road safety measures.

## Data Preparation and Visualization:

The initial phase involved meticulous data cleaning to retain pertinent fields essential for analysis. Key attributes such as accident severity, date, location coordinates, and casualty details were retained for further analysis. Subsequently, the curated dataset was imported into Tableau, where an extract connection was established to optimize query processing time.

## Dashboard Composition:

The Tableau dashboard comprises multiple sheets, each designed to offer unique insights into road accident trends and patterns. Employing a diverse range of visualizations including KPIs, sparkline graphs, donut charts, bar charts, and symbol maps, the dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of road safety metrics.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

### 1.Total Accidents
### 2.Total Casualties
### 3.Fatal Casualties
### 4.Serious Casualties
### 5.Slight Casualties

## Dynamic Analysis:

The dashboard facilitates dynamic analysis through the incorporation of parameters such as Current Year, Previous Year, and Accident Severity. Users can compare year-on-year changes for each KPI, obtaining insights into trends and identifying areas for improvement in road safety measures.

## Additional Insights:
### 1.Casualties by Vehicle Type: 
Provides insights into the distribution of casualties based on vehicle types, allowing for targeted interventions.
### 2.Donut Charts: 
Showcase casualties categorized by weather conditions and road surface conditions, aiding in identifying high-risk scenarios.
### 3. Bar Chart: 
Illustrates casualties based on road types, facilitating the identification of accident-prone road segments.
### 4. Symbol Map: 
Displays casualties by location, enabling stakeholders to pinpoint areas requiring immediate attention.

## Dynamic Functionality:

The dashboard's dynamic nature empowers users to explore different parameters and filter options, enabling tailored analyses to suit specific requirements. Whether it's comparing yearly trends, analyzing casualty distributions, or identifying hotspot areas, the dashboard provides a versatile platform for informed decision-making and proactive road safety initiatives.
